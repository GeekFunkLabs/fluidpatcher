# Plugins

[LADSPA](https://www.ladspa.org/) plugins are optional separate programs that provide additional audio effects. It is possible to compile and use them on other platforms, but at this time support is only provided for Linux usage.

## Installation

To install a base LADSPA system and several batches of plugins, enter

```bash
sudo apt-get install ladspa-sdk swh-plugins tap-plugins wah-plugins
```

To compile and install `patchcord.so`, which is used for mixing channels to outputs, go to the `src/` folder and enter

```bash
sudo gcc -shared patchcord.c -o /usr/lib/ladspa/patchcord.so
```

## Setup

To enable plugins, set the fluidsetting `synth.ladspa.active: 1` in the config file, and set `plugindir` to the location where plugins are stored (most Linux distributions put them in `/usr/lib/ladspa` by default). The fluidsetting `synth.audio-groups` can be used to create separate effects mixing channels. The audio generated by each MIDI channel is assigned to an audio group in order, wrapping around if there are fewer groups than MIDI channels.

```yaml
bankdir: config/banks
plugindir: /usr/lib/ladspa
fluidsettings:
  midi.autoconnect: 1
  player.reset-synth: 0
  synth.audio.groups: 16
  synth.ladspa.active: 1
currentbank: bank1.yaml
```

## Usage

To add plugins to a bank file, create a `ladspafx` section as described in [Creating Banks](bank_files.md#ladspafx) and add a named section for each plugin. Setting the parameters correctly requires knowing some details about the plugin, which can be found using the `analyseplugin` command provided by the LADSPA SDK. Enter the command, followed by the full path to the plugin file. Here is the output for the `amp` plugin file:

```shell
$ analyseplugin /usr/lib/ladspa/amp.so

Plugin Name: "Mono Amplifier"
Plugin Label: "amp_mono"
Plugin Unique ID: 1048
Maker: "Richard Furse (LADSPA example plugins)"
Copyright: "None"
Must Run Real-Time: No
Has activate() Function: No
Has deactivate() Function: No
Has run_adding() Function: No
Environment: Normal or Hard Real-Time
Ports:  "Gain" input, control, 0 to ..., default 1, logarithmic
        "Input" input, audio
        "Output" output, audio

Plugin Name: "Stereo Amplifier"
Plugin Label: "amp_stereo"
Plugin Unique ID: 1049
Maker: "Richard Furse (LADSPA example plugins)"
Copyright: "None"
Must Run Real-Time: No
Has activate() Function: No
Has deactivate() Function: No
Has run_adding() Function: No
Environment: Normal or Hard Real-Time
Ports:  "Gain" input, control, 0 to ..., default 1, logarithmic
        "Input (Left)" input, audio
        "Output (Left)" output, audio
        "Input (Right)" input, audio
        "Output (Right)" output, audio
```

As in the example above, some plugin files contain multiple plugins. The `plugin` parameter is used to set the label of the desired plugin. To route audio through the plugin, the `audio` parameter needs to be a list of the audio port names. List the inputs first, followed by the outputs. Part of the name can be used, as long as it is a unique match. The alias `mono` sets the ports to `Input, Output`, and `stereo` sets them to `Input L, Input R, Output L, Output R`. The control port names are used to set initial values with the `val` parameter, or connect router rules.

The `group` parameter is a list of the audio groups to route through the plugin. The number of groups is set in the config file as described above, and numbering begins with 1. Multiple audio groups can be sent through a plugin and are not mixed, but each additional group increases CPU load.
 
The bank file snippet below sets up the `amp_stereo` plugin and a router rule to control its Gain using CC# 13:

```yaml
ladspafx:
  Stereo Amp:
	lib: amp
	plugin: amp_stereo
	audio: Input (L, Input (R, Output (L, Output (R
	vals:
	  Gain: 0.5
	group: 3
router_rules:
  - {type: cc, par1: 13, ladspafx: Stereo Amp, port: Gain, par2: 0-127=0-1}
```

If `synth.audio-groups` were set to `4`, and assuming there are 16 MIDI channels, this plugin would affect audio from channels 3, 7, 11, and 15.
